 <h1>Text-Based-RPG C++ OOP Game</h1>
 <h3>OOP course final project</h3>

<b>The project was split in 3 stages:</b>
<ol>
<li>
  <i>Stage 1:</i>
  <ul>
    <li>minimum of 4 classes;</li>
    <li>classes variable types: Int/Long, Bool, Char, Char*, Char c[100], Float, Int*/Float*, Double, Const, Static;</li>
    <li>implement Getters and Setters;</li>
    <li>atleast 2 Parameterized Constructors ( one of the parameters has to be Const and/or Static);</li>
    <li>Default Constructors;</li>
    <li>Copy Constructors;</li>
    <li>Destructors;</li>
    <li>override: =, ==, <<, >>, [](index operator), ++ or --,+ or - or * or /,  < or > or >= or <= (conditional operator), implicit or explicit cast operator;</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>
  <i>Stage 2:</i>
  <ul>
    <li>extend 2 classes and add new atributes and methods (IS A relation);</li>
    <li>implement 1 abstract class;</li>
    <li>implement 1 interface;</li>
    <li>implement a class that exemplifies the HAS A concept;</li>
    <li>exemplify virtualization;</li>
    <li>create a clear class hierarchy</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>
  <i>Stage 3:</i>
  <ul>
    <li>implement from the STL vector: a set, a list, a vector and a map;</li>
    <li>file I/O;</li>
    <li>exception handling;</li>
    <li>simple console menu(switch case);</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<b>How does it work:</b>
<p> The user creates his character that starts at level 1, 100 maxHP, 15 dmg, 1 def and 0/100 exp. </p>
<p> At this moment the player can choose to fight monster for Exp or for Loot.</p>
<p> So monsters can either drop exp, that helps the player level up ( when the exp is at 100% a boss fight option will apear in the menu, and only after 
the boss is defeated the player will level up ), or loot (weapons that increase +1 the player damage, armors that increase +1 the player defense, or hp potions
that can be used during monster or boss fights).</p>
<p> There is also a "rest" option that will heal the player to 100%.</p>
<p> The global monster name can be changed.<p>
<p> You can also spend exp points in the shop for +1 dmg, +1 def, 1 hp potion. </p>
<p> You can gamble exp for +1 dmg or +1 def.</p>
